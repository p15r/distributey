# Prerequisites ðŸ“š
- `openssl`
- `docker` (tested with `19.03.13`)
  - add user to group `docker`(`sudo usermod -a -G docker USER`) or run scripts with `sudo`
- `docker-compose` (tested with `v3.7`)
- `terrafrom` binary accessible via `$PATH` (tested with `v0.13.4`)
- TLS certificate & key for reverse proxy.
  - `Nginx` is used as reverse proxy. Create a certificate that matches your desired URL (`CN`) of `distributey`. Most key consumers, such as Salesforce, require a valid certificate, signed by an official root CA. Store the certificate as `distributey/docker/certs/nginx.crt` and the key as `distributey/docker/certs/nginx.key`.
  - Use the following command to generate self-signed certificates (for development purposes only): `openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 999 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout distributey/docker/certs/nginx.key -out distributey/docker/certs/nginx.crt -subj "/C=No/ST=NoState/L=NoLocation/O=NoOrg/OU=NoOrgUnit/CN=NoCommonName"`
- `distributey` comes with some helper tools that can be found under `dev/`. To use them, the python dependencies must be satisfied
  - create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv /path/to/venv`
  - activate virtual environment: `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate`
  - install dependencies: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - type `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment
